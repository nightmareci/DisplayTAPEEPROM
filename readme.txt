Simplest usage, which just opens a file named "eeprom" in the current directory:
display-tap-eeprom

Use a specific EEPROM file:
display-tap-eeprom <path-to-EEPROM-file-name>

Replace initials with a longer name (EEPROM file name is required).
You can have as many replacement specifiers as you want:
display-tap-eeprom <path-to-EEPROM-file-name> AJK:Kitaru AMN:Amnesia

The display format of records is meant to match the tetrisconcept.net TAP records list format.
